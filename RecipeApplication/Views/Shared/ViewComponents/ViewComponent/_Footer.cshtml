            "A recipe book is one that you use daily and what we in our family
            call 'a living book' — a book that you use all the time,
            not just read once and discard on the shelf.
            Recipes are by nature derivative and meant to be shared -
            that is how they improve, are changed, how new ideas are formed. ”
